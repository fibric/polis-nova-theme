### The chosen colors were inspired by the glowing LEDs of Denon's SC5000M music player series.

#### Spot errors at a glance

<p style="margin: -1em auto -1em">
Unlike other color schemes, the color red is not used for syntax element highlighting. Instead, red is only used to represent syntax errors, invalid code, and linting errors.
</p>
<p style="margin: -1em auto 0">

*Look out! Until the final version 1.0, red is also used for identifying syntax elements that are not yet stylized.* **Report red syntax elements!**
</p>

#### Mathematically derived.

<p style="margin: 0 auto 0">
The base colors, the window colors, and the text color are the only manually selected colors and balanced using the Equiangular algorithm. All other colors are mathematical derivatives of the base colors. Deliberately used mathematical inaccuracies in color derivations provide a natural-looking color mixture.
</p>

#### Enjoyable Terminal.

<p style="margin: -1em auto 0">
This color scheme has been carefully prepared so that even the terminal provides eye-friendly colors.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 auto 0">
To do so, select `Preferences -> Terminal`. In the tab `[Theme]`, select `[Theme]: Custom`. It is best to select "Polis" under `[Apply Theme]` too.
